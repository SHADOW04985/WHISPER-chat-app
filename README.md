- It is a simple app where you can chat with other people using the app.
- Built using the MERN technologies along with Socket.IO.
- Firstly it lands you to the Login/Register page where you choose accordingly.
- As simple it is to log in, it is that simple to log out as well and use your other account.
- Built-in feature to choose a profile avatar among thousands of avatars while creating your account.
- Each time you refresh the avatars page, a new set of avatars appears for you to choose.
- After login it takes you to the chats page which contains the chat history of the user with other users.
- Since most websites make it easy for you to use some specific buttons like the enter button to login after entering your details,this feature is also implemented so that you don't have to manually click the login button.
- Contains separate chat window for every user you chat with.
- Dark mode is default as it is the most chosen theme by the internet users
- As we are using Socket.IO, the website has dynamic capabilities which provides the infamous typing indicators during an active chat
